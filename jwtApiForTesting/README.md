# jwt testing api

## Usage

- the api was tested on node `v14.21.3` since the server has that version
- tested okay with postman

    ```json
    {
        "username": "user1",
        "password": "password1"
    }
    ```

    
    ```json
    {
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "adminpassword"
    }
    ```
